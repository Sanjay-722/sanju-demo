            <p>The first big rule in sales is that if the person leaves empty handed ,they are likely not going to come back.

            <p>One way you can keep a conversation going is to avoid asking questions that have yes or no answers. For example, 
                if you're selling a service plan, don't ever ask "Are you interested in our 3 or 5 year service plan?" Instead, 
                ask "Are you interested in the 3 year service plan or the 5 year plan, which is a better value? At first glance, 
                they appear to be asking the same thing, and while a customer can still opt out, it's harder for them to opt out 
                of the second question because they have to say more than just no</p>
